# E552 Final Project: Circuit Simulator

## Running the Project

This project uses Maven as a build system. To run the project, use the exec
plugin like so:

```shell
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.args="circuit_name inputs..."
```

`-Dexec.args=""` is used to pass CLI arguments to the program. The first
argument should be the name of a circuit in the `saved_circuits` folder (not
including the `.txt` extension). The second and any subsequent arguments should
be strings containing only the characters '01xX \t', representing the signal(s)
to be passed to the circuit.

## Circuit File Format

Note: there is currently no ability to make comments in circuit files, I'm just
using "//" here to make the explanation easier.

```c++
IMPORT notnot   // defines what circuits we are importing in
                // must be contained in the saved_circuits folder

temp orary -> out   // defines the contacts of a circuit, ie. the
                    // names of the inputs and the outputs
                    // inputs are on the left of the arrow
                    // outputs are on the right

notnot temp -> temp1    // defines an internal component of type "notnot"
                        // all arguments after the component type and to
                        // the left of the arrow are input wires of the
                        // component, arguments after the arrow are
                        // output wires
notnot orary -> temp2   // same as above
AND temp1 temp2 -> out  // defines an internal component of type AND
                        // (the built-in AND gate), supplying two input
                        // wires and one output wire.
```

Names of the built-in gates:

- `AND`
- `NOT`
- `OR`
- `NOR`
- `NAND`
- `XOR`
- `XNOR`

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a working logic gate simulator
which allows the composition of logic gates to create more complex circuits.
These circuits should also be able to contain other circuits, as well as
possible feedback loops that lead to the circuit stabilizing.

Additionally, the project should have a way to save and load circuits designs
to/from a file, as well as a way to provide input signals and visualize the
output of circuits over time.

### `enum Signal`

Signals represent the current value on a wire. They can be high (HI), low (LO),
or unknown (X). The signal enum also has other support methods defined on it
which make the conversion to/from strings easier.

### `class Wire`

Wires represent the connectors between different gates and circuits. They hold
the Signal they contain, as well as a name to make it easier for us as humans to
check which wires are where, etc. The name isn't necessary for calculations,
however.

### `interface Logic`

Logic represents something that can accept inputs, performs some transformation,
and yields some outputs. This will be implemented by the base Gate classes, as
well as the circuit classes.

### `abstract class Gate implements Logic`

Represents the smallest units of logic. Gate implements all the methods of
Logic, but remains abstract as it leaves the `propagate()` method to its
children to implement. Gates are assumed to have 1+ input wires, and a single
output wire (except for the NOT gate).

### `class GateXXX extends Gate`

There are six child classes of gate that all have the same structure, a simple
constructor which calls the constructor of their parent, and overriding the
`propagate` method to perform the logic from `inputs` to `output`. The only
special case is GateNot, which has a constructor which takes a single `Wire` as
input, as opposed to a list like the other Gates.

### `class Contact implements Logic`

Circuits can contain many things internally, gates, inner wires, and entire
other sub-circuits. Once a circuit is created we'd like to only deal with the
points of contact the separate the outside world from the interior of the
circuit. To ensure this functionality circuits will always have a Contact object
attached to every of its input and output wires.

A contact has two Wire references, one which goes into the contact, and the
other which goes out. The circuit's own wires (and their names) are preserved,
but we can still hook them up to the outside world. The `in` wire always enters
the contact, and the `out` wire always exits it. The way to know whether this is
an input or output connection is via the `inbound` boolean.

### `class Circuit implements Logic`

A `Logic` structure which contains other `Logic` components that are wired
together. This includes basic `Gate`s as well as other possible sub-circuits.
The one key limitation of `Circuit`s is that they cannot contain feedback loops.
If a feedback loop is detected during construction, an exception will be thrown.
This limitation allows us to guarantee that a single call to the `propagate` /
`inspect` methods will fully update all outputs, and they won't change until the
inputs are modified.

### `class FeedbackCircuit extends Circuit`

Removes the limitation of the `Circuit` class of having feedback loops. A single
call to `propagate` is not guaranteed to stabilize the outputs, so the
`propagate` function will recursively call itself until the outputs do not
change. This approach was the simplest way to implement the desired
functionality, but it comes with a few downsides.

1. Circuits which don't stabilize
   - This will lead to infinite recursive calls of the `propagate` until the JVM
     runs out of memory and terminates. A possible solution would be to allow
     the user to define a recursion depth limit, and we stop evaluating the
     circuit past that point, either keeping the potential garbage value or
     throwing an exception stating that evaluation failed.
2. Worse performance
   - The need to call `propagate` multiple times will cause performance drops
     compared to standard circuits for massive circuits, which is why they've
     been separated into two different classes. At runtime when a circuit file
     is being read in, the program will first try to construct the circuit as a
     normal `Circuit`, and only if that fails will it use a `FeedbackCircuit`.
     This is also the case when constructing sub-circuits inside a `Circuit`.

### `class XXXException extends Exception`

There are three custom exceptions defined, all of which extend the Exception
class (so they are checked by the compiler). They're all fairly self-explanatory
based on the names, however the user should only ever see the
`MalformedSignalException` and `InvalidLogicParametersException`.
